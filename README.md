# Integer-Count
A c++ and java program counting the number of times each "integer" appeared in the input file.
Dynamic array is used to store the count of each integer. The output file will have the first column specifying the integer, while the second column specifies the corresponding count. 1-D array is used to keep track of the count. The size of the array is the largest number plus 1 since the array index starts at 0.
